These four files are among the suite of R programs used in the Dissonance study.
They are unedited and contain no extra explantion other the the code itself.
They generates the sample required, perform the tests, identify the positive and negative results at 5 per cent level and record in a matrix. (Function - Mat1)
Then another piece of code summarise the resultant matrix. (Function -Mat2)
Third piece of code genereates simulations for the required number of runs.(Function - Mat3)
